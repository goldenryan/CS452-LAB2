My shader header does:

1.takes in the shader info from my main program
2.creates memory for each shader one after another
3.immediately after memory is allocated for each shader, the source code is compiled for each
4.The program gets created and attaches the shaders to it
5.The program gets linked to my testlab2.cpp program
6.The program then gets installed as the current rendering state and turns the shaders into executable form
